##Hello 

This is my little python projet and it is finally finished as I want to. 
Its little game where you have to find a treasure. 
Game is made in Czech but I will do International version too in the future Game is finally playable without any issues. 
I have to make it harder since last patch I got issues because it cannot be done or like it could be but you can drop into a spam issues of ohh you find a enemy and there was a loop chance soo I fixed and even make it harder. How? I remove "run" from the battle and I made that thing like oh you run game is done and you lose. 
Game is small so this change shouldnt be that far impact. More information in additional versions. See ya
